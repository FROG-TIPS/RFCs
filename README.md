# RFFC

FROG MUST CHANGE AS NEEDED BUT IS STILL COOL TO TODAY'S YOUTH. THIS REPOSITORY LISTS ALL PUBLIC PROPOSALS FOR CHANGES TO FROG PROTOCOLS, DEALINGS, WHEELINGS (RFC-2.TXT) AND MAJOR DESIGN DECISIONS THAT SHOULD NOT BE MADE IN ANY SPECIFIC REPOSITORY. THESE ARE **R**EQUEST **F**OR **F**ROG **C**HANGES. DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT STANDS FOR SOMETHING ELSE.

## SUBMISSION

PLEASE PUT IN A PULL REQUEST TO THIS REPOSITORY WITH EXACTLY ONE FILE CONTAINING A WELL-WRITTEN RFC.

- DON'T WORRY ABOUT NUMBERING AS FROG WILL SORT THAT OUT LATER, OPTIMIZING FOR HUMOUR.
- YOU'D THINK THIS GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT IT MUST BE ENTIRELY CAPITALIZED.
- LET'S FOCUS ON THE FROG, PEOPLE.

## NOMINATION PROCESS

RFFCS WILL BE DISCUSSED BY OUR TECHNICAL STAFF AND YOU WILL HEAR BACK WITHIN AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF TIME. NO SALESMAN WILL CALL.
